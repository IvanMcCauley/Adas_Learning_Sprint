# Coding Sprint: Closing the Gap for ADAS & Autonomy Roles üöóüíª

This repository tracks my personal upskilling sprint focused on mastering Python and C++ for real-world autonomous systems.

I‚Äôm a Mechatronic Engineering graduate with hands-on project experience, including YOLOv8 detection, BEV transformation, and A* path planning, and I‚Äôm now deepening my low-level programming expertise to meet the demands of ADAS, robotics, and autonomous vehicle engineering roles.

To close this gap and become fully job-ready for high-impact engineering positions, I‚Äôm using this repo to:

- ‚úÖ Practice critical programming skills in C++ and Python
- ‚úÖ Rebuild core math/control foundations for robotics
- ‚úÖ Complete focused micro-projects tied to planning, perception, and control
- ‚úÖ Log daily/weekly progress with full transparency (`log.md`)
- ‚úÖ Build tangible fluency through hands-on code

This sprint is part of a larger plan to become an **independent, high-leverage AV engineer** - fluent in the full autonomy stack and able to contribute meaningfully to mission-critical systems.

üîç **Focus areas**: C++ fundamentals, embedded logic, Python simulation, A*, PID, ROS 2 (soon), and real-time decision-making.

üìå Updated frequently. Reflects learning milestones.

## Day 1 ‚Äì Environment Setup + Core Math Refresh

- Set up Python, C++, Git, VS Code, Linux (WSL2)
- Wrote some basic python and C++ scripts to get warmed up
- Reviewed calculus (v = ds/dt), 2D rotation matrices
- Started PID controller summary in notes/control.md


## Day 2 - Physics Refresh & C++ Work
- Reviewed key physics concepts for vehicle dynamics and control theory and added Physics_Notes.md
- Verified C++ environment setup (Linux toolchain + VS Code integration).
- Compiled and ran first test program to confirm toolchain functionality.
- Configured VS Code debugger for step-by-step execution.
- Maintained organized folder structure (`Week1/day2_cpp`) for ongoing C++ exercises.


## Day 3 ‚Äî C++
- Implemented: basics, I/O, conditions, loops (for/while/do-while), arrays, calculator
- Key skills: `cin` validation, `switch`, edge cases, `-Wall -Wextra`
- Code: `Week1/day3_cpp/*`
- Next: functions/headers, `std::vector`, `<algorithm>`, CMake

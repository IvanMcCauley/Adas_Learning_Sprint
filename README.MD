# Coding Sprint: Closing the Gap for ADAS & Autonomy Roles üöóüíª

This repository tracks my coding sprint to close the gap between my current skills and what‚Äôs needed for real-world ADAS and autonomous systems work.

I‚Äôm a Mechatronic Engineering graduate with project experience in YOLOv8 detection, BEV transformation, and A* path planning. Now I‚Äôm focusing on building deeper fluency in C++ and Python to meet the demands of embedded systems, planning, and perception roles in autonomy.

The repo is where I:
- ‚úÖ Practice critical programming skills in C++ and Python  
- ‚úÖ Rebuild core math/control foundations for robotics  
- ‚úÖ Complete focused micro-projects tied to planning, perception, and control  
- ‚úÖ Track progress day-by-day 
- ‚úÖ Build tangible fluency through hands-on code  

üîç **Focus areas**: C++ fundamentals, embedded logic, Python simulation, A*, PID, ROS 2, and real-time decision-making.  

üìå Updated frequently ‚Äî each day‚Äôs work is logged and visible here.

# Projects 
[braking_decision_lib](https://github.com/IvanMcCauley/braking_decision_lib) - C++17 lib + CLI, CSV mode, tests, micro-benchmark.

## Day 1 - Environment Setup + Core Math Refresh

- Set up Python, C++, Git, VS Code, Linux (WSL2)
- Wrote some basic python and C++ scripts to get warmed up
- Reviewed calculus (v = ds/dt), 2D rotation matrices
- Started PID controller summary in notes/control.md


## Day 2 - Physics Refresh & C++ Work
- Reviewed key physics concepts for vehicle dynamics and control theory and added Physics_Notes.md
- Verified C++ environment setup (Linux toolchain + VS Code integration).
- Compiled and ran first test program to confirm toolchain functionality.
- Configured VS Code debugger for step-by-step execution.
- Maintained organized folder structure (`Week1/day2_cpp`) for ongoing C++ exercises.


## Day 3 - C++
- Implemented: basics, I/O, conditions, loops (for/while/do-while), arrays, calculator
- Key skills: `cin` validation, `switch`, edge cases, `-Wall -Wextra`
- Code: `Week1/day3_cpp/*`

## Day 4 ‚Äì C++ Memory Safety & Const
- Pointers & references basics (`pointers_refs.cpp`)  
- Pass-by-pointer vs pass-by-reference (`2_4a`, `2_4b`)  
- Return by reference (`2_5_return_by_ref.cpp`)  
- Dynamic allocation with `new`/`delete` (`dynamic.cpp`, `dynamic_array.cpp`)  
- `std::vector` basics + dataset return (`vector_basic.cpp`, `2_7_*.cpp`)  
- Memory pitfalls: dangling pointer, double delete (`2_6_*`)  
- Safe fixes: return by value, vectors  
- Const correctness: const params, const pointers, const member fns (`3_*.cpp`)  
- Capstone: ADAS-style braking/reaction distance + `needs_brake()` (`safety.cpp`) 

## Day 5 - C++ modularity (braking_decision_lib)
- Built `day5_braking/`: library + CLI + tiny tests from Day 4 `safety.cpp`.
- Practiced: headers vs sources, default 10% margin, `assert` guards, CMake lib/exe.
- Run: `cd day5_braking && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make && ./brake_cli && ./braking_tests`
- Docs: see `day5_braking/README.md`.

## Day 6 - C++ modularity II (tests + margin)
- Added `--margin` flag to CLI; extra margin tests; optional strict build (`-Werror`).
- Run: `cd day5_braking/build && cmake -DBRK_STRICT=ON .. && make && ./brake_cli --margin 0.2 && ./braking_tests`

## Day 8 - CSV I/O
Added `--csv` mode to the braking CLI; learned file I/O (`ifstream`), line/token parsing (`getline`, `stringstream`), and safe number conversion (`stod`). Added tiny fixtures + a shell test that diffs expected vs actual output.

## Day 9 
Added input clamping/validation to the braking CLI (interactive + `--csv`), and a tiny benchmark (~14.6 ns/op over 1e6 evals on WSL2, g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG).

## Day 10 ‚Äî Packaging & polish
Added MIT license, install rules (CMake), local install layout, and tagged v0.1.0. All CSV tests green.

# Coding Sprint: Closing the Gap for ADAS & Autonomy Roles 🚗💻

This repository tracks my personal upskilling sprint focused on mastering **Python and C++** for real-world autonomous systems.

I’m a Mechatronic Engineering graduate with hands-on project experience (YOLOv8 detection, BEV transformation, A* path planning), but until recently, I relied heavily on AI and online help to write or debug code.

To close this gap and become fully job-ready for **ADAS, robotics, and autonomous vehicle engineering**, I’m using this repo to:

- ✅ Practice critical programming skills in C++ and Python
- ✅ Rebuild core math/control foundations for robotics
- ✅ Complete focused micro-projects tied to planning, perception, and control
- ✅ Log daily/weekly progress with full transparency (`log.md`)
- ✅ Build tangible fluency through hands-on code, not tutorials

This sprint is part of a larger plan to become an **independent, high-leverage AV engineer** - fluent in the full autonomy stack and able to contribute meaningfully to mission-critical systems.

🔍 **Focus areas**: C++ fundamentals, embedded logic, Python simulation, A*, PID, ROS 2 (soon), and real-time decision-making.

📌 Updated frequently. Reflects learning milestones.

## Day 1 – Environment Setup + Core Math Refresh

- Set up Python, C++, Git, VS Code, Linux (WSL2)
- Wrote some basic python and C++ scripts to get warmed up
- Reviewed calculus (v = ds/dt), 2D rotation matrices
- Started PID controller summary in notes/control.md
